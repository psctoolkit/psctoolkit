# PSCToolkit

This repository contains the various libraries that make up the Parallel Sparse Computation Toolkit (PSCToolkit) as submodules. 

- PSBLAS
- PSBLAS-EXT
- AMG4PSBLAS

All the relevant information can be found at: [psctoolkit.github.io](https://psctoolkit.github.io/). Moreover, it contains a version of the SUNDIALS library interfacing the PSCToolkit routines for linear algebra (distributed matrices and vectors), linear solvers and preconditioners.

## How to get

To clone the **the repository in the maintenance versions** do 
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/psctoolkit/psctoolkit.git
```
or if you want to use ssh:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:psctoolkit/psctoolkit.git
```
To keep the development version updated with the changes in the individual repositories, use the command: 
```bash
git submodule update --recursive --remote
```
or to execute ```git pull``` inside each of the folders to synchronize to the latest version. 

>[!warning]
> the various submodules point to mutually compatible versions of the library. Branch switching and pull operations could damage compatibility, especially moving into development branches. The easiest way is to download the latest **stable release**. This contains all versions of the packages that can be compiled together. 

### Docker

Each push to this repository starts building a docker image on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/psctoolkit/psctoolkit). You can download the latest compiled version from a machine running Docker with the command:
```
docker pull psctoolkit/psctoolkit
```
Once the image is obtained, you can launch an interactive shell on your machine with:
```
docker run -it psctoolkit:latest /bin/bash
```
If you want to build everything on your local machine, an alternative is - once the repository has been cloned - run
```
cd psctoolkit
docker build - < Dockerfile
```

## How to install

The possible installation order are:

1) PSBLAS -> PSBLAS-EXT -> AMG4PSBLAS -> SUNDIALS
2) PSBLAS -> AMG4PSBLAS

Each of the libraries contains its own installation instructions. See information on [https://psctoolkit.github.io/libraries/](https://psctoolkit.github.io/libraries/).
